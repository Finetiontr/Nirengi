# Design System: nirengi

<!-- Source of truth: src/styles/global.css. Tokens are RGB channels (light on
     :root, dark on [data-theme="dark"]) mapped to Tailwind colours in
     @theme inline. Hex values above are the light theme; dark values are in
     .impeccable/design.json → extensions.colorMeta.*.dark.
     Round 2 ("Pafta", 2026-10-08) replaced the round-1 "Pressable Road". -->

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "Pafta"**

A pafta is a survey map sheet. Nirengi means triangulation point: every verified piece of work is one more point on your map, and leagues are elevations from Zemin to Zirve. The world is a white ground cut by 2px seams, drawn with survey geometry: rounded triangle markers instead of circles and coins, faint contour lines on hero panels, a dashed trail that inks itself up to where you stand, ripple rings instead of bounces. Type is Bricolage Grotesque in sentence case. Keys sit on a 3px lip of their own hue and sink onto it when pressed. Every hue owns one concept.

The mechanics are a lesson app's (weekly goal, streak, league, quests, feedback bar, celebration). The geometry, type, icons, motion and structure are ours. Depth stays one tap below: reasoning, formulas and thresholds live behind "Neden?" in a sheet. Niri, the triangle surveyor, guides, reacts and celebrates, at most once per screen. The genç face (phone-first) gets the game layer; the kurum face (desk-first) keeps keys, cards, sheets, feedback and Niri as assistant, and drops XP, league and streak.

**Why Pafta.** Round 1 read as a Duolingo copy (rounded heavy type, uppercase chunky keys, a circle lesson path, flames and chests). Round 2 kept the mechanics and the simplicity and replaced everything you can see: geometry, type, iconography, motion and screen structure.

**Key Characteristics:**
- White ground, 2px seams, no hairlines, no blurred shadows on resting surfaces.
- The triangle is the primitive: logo, Niri, survey markers, week days, trail steps, confetti, rank medals, verification glyphs.
- Contour lines and dashed survey trails carry the map; the current point pings with ripple rings.
- Bricolage Grotesque Variable, sentence case everywhere, keys included.
- Keys and pressable cards carry a 3px same-hue lip and sink 3px on press.
- Seven palette roles, each bound to one concept, each with a lip and a tint.
- Every action answers with `feedback()`; milestones answer with `celebrate()`; Niri reacts to both.

## Colors

A full-palette system where hue is semantics: indigo acts, six other hues each name exactly one concept.

### Primary
- **Act Indigo** (`indigo`, `indigo-lip`, `indigo-tint`): primary keys, the next-step card, active nav (text and triangle pointer), links, "Neden?", focus rings (indigo at 55%), caret, wordmark, Niri's body, the Kurum onaylı level. On the kurum face it stands in for anything that would otherwise be orange.

### Secondary
- **Seri Orange** (`orange`, `orange-lip`, `orange-tint`, text `orange-ink`): the weekly streak only. The beacon icon, lit week-day triangles, today's dashed triangle, the Seri celebration tile. Genç face only.
- **Verified Cyan** (`cyan`, `cyan-lip`, `cyan-tint`): Doğrulandı. Level pill, verify keys, mid-range score rings (55 to 74), the ping ellipse under the Bugün marker icon.
- **League Purple** (`purple`, `purple-lip`, `purple-tint`): lig and topluluk. The climbed part of the league elevation profile, community actions.

### Tertiary
- **XP Gold** (`gold`, `gold-lip`, `gold-tint`, text `gold-ink`): XP only. The faceted gem icon, the Görevler folded-map icon, the "Kazanılan XP" tile.
- **Done Green** (`green`, `green-lip`, `green-tint`): tamam. Planted waypoints, good feedback, high score rings (75+), promotion zone, positive deltas in `green-lip`.
- **Problem Red** (`red`, `red-lip`, `red-tint`): hata and problem. Bad feedback, failed checks, demotion zone, a record changed after verification.
- **Tier colours** (`tier-zemin` to `tier-zirve`): the five elevations. Only the Lig ridge icon and tier markers use them.

### Neutral
- **Ground** (`ground`, `ground-2`, `ground-3`): page and card face; hover wash, field fill and waiting markers; disabled keys, bar tracks, locked markers.
- **Ink** (`ink`) headings and numbers that matter; **Ink 2** (`ink-2`) body; **Ink 3** (`ink-3`) captions, hints, inactive nav, demo-data notes; **Ink 4** (`ink-4`) icons, disabled key text and placeholders only.
- **Seam** (`seam`, `seam-2`): 2px borders; `seam-2` for contour lines, the undrawn dashed trail, waiting and locked marker lips.

### Named Rules
**The One Concept, One Hue Rule.** Indigo = act, orange = seri, cyan = doğrulandı, purple = lig/topluluk, gold = XP, green = tamam, red = problem. Never borrow a hue for its look.

**The Orange Stays Young Rule.** No kurum screen shows orange. A low fit score on the kurum side is indigo; kurum warnings are red or neutral ink.

**The Ink Tokens Rule.** `orange`, `gold` and their lips are fills, never text on a light ground; coloured text uses `orange-ink` / `gold-ink` (they re-point to the bright tones in dark mode). `ink-4` is never text a person must read; readable text bottoms out at `ink-3`.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Bricolage Grotesque Variable (optical sizing on; ui-sans-serif, system-ui fallback)
**Body Font:** Bricolage Grotesque Variable
**Label/Mono Font:** JetBrains Mono Variable for ids, hashes, codes and formulas

**Character:** One grotesque with optical sizing, carried by weight and tight negative tracking at the top of the ramp. Bricolage sets darker than a rounded face, so the Tailwind weight names are remapped a notch lighter: `font-semibold` 560, `font-bold` 620, `font-extrabold` 700, `font-black` 780.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (`h-hero`; 800, clamp(36px, 5.4vw, 64px), 1, -0.035em): landing hero and 404 only.
- **Headline** (`h-page`; 800, 30px phone / 34px md+, 1.05, -0.03em): one page title per page.
- **Title** (`h-sec`; 750, 21px, 1.15, -0.02em): section headings, card titles, rail headings. Sheet titles are 20px `font-black`.
- **Lead** (`lead`; 450, 17px, relaxed, `ink-3`): the sentence under a page title.
- **Body** (450, 16px, 1.55, `ink-2`): running text; card copy is 14 to 15px `font-bold` in `ink-3`.
- **Caption** (`cap`; 650, 13px, `ink-3`): metadata, demo-data notes, map labels.
- **Label** (700, 15px, `ink`, sentence case): field labels. Hints 14px 450 `ink-3`.
- **Key** (700, 16px, -0.005em, sentence case): buttons; 14px small, 17px large. Nav items 16px, `font-semibold` inactive, `font-bold` active.
- **Numbers**: tabular figures (`num`) wherever a value can change; values count up over ~800ms.

### Named Rules
**The Sentence Case Rule.** Nothing is uppercase: not keys, not nav, not labels, not day names. A key's label is a short sentence ("Projeye git", "Bayrağı dik").

**The No Kicker Rule.** Nothing small sits above a heading. Headings stand alone; context goes in the lead below.

**The Plain Words Rule.** Address the reader as "sen". Use plain terms: netlik puanı, deneme projesi (short: proje), kayıt defteri, isimsiz inceleme, ihtiyaç kartı; levels are Beyan / Doğrulandı / Kurum onaylı (S1 to S3 only on /yontem). Never sandık, alev or şimşek. Demo data says it is fictional ("kurgusal").

## Layout

One shell (`App.astro`) renders both faces; `html[data-mode="genc|kurum"]` hides one with `.only-genc` / `.only-kurum` before any script runs.

- **Top bar (all widths):** sticky, 60px (68px from lg) with a 2px bottom seam, on the page's own shell width so the wordmark sits on the content's left edge. Right side: the Genç/Kurum switch (desktop), the "Niri'ye sor" key where the Şimdi line is not on screen (kurum, Kanıt bağla), then a round menu key. The menu key's three lines fold into a cross and the popover card (switch on phones, account, Yöntem, Tema, Demo turu) drops in from it.
- **Deck (all widths):** the page navigation floats at the foot of the screen (see Navigation). No sidebar: content is centred in its shell, padded 16px (24px from sm, 40px from lg) and 160px (128px on desktop) at the bottom so the deck never covers the last line.
- **Content width:** narrow 1080px for genç, wide 1240px for kurum. Genç pages centre a 600px column.
- **Right rail (xl, 1280px+):** 340px, 48px gap. On genç it is one "Bu haftan" card (league, week, this week's route) divided by 2px seams; `omit` drops what the page already shows. Hidden below xl, so it is never the only path to anything.
- **Rhythm:** card padding 16 to 20px; 12px between list cards; 20px between stacked blocks; 40px before a major section.
- **Flows** (Kanıt bağla, İhtiyaç sihirbazı): no deck; the screen is the flow's. Kanıt bağla is a 560px column, a quiet "Geri" at the top, NiriSays per step, and the primary key in flow after the content: no X, no lesson progress chrome, no pinned footer. The sihirbaz is 13 screens long, so it keeps its X (with a save-or-leave sheet) and a step bar; its keys still sit in flow.
- **Reading screen** ("Metninden çıkardıklarım", after Taslağa dönüştür): one card of field rows, each with its value and, below in `ink-3`, the sentence of the kurum's text it came from; missing fields say "Metninde yok, soracağım". What the guard refused sits in an inset "Almadıklarım" panel with a red cross and the reason. A hint names who read the text (the model, or the rules when the model was out of reach). Suggested criteria appear only on the criteria step, under "Önerilerim", each with an "Ekle" line key and its basis sentence.

## Motion

Motion explains order and cause; nothing moves for decoration alone.

- **Page arrival:** the view transition carries the change of page; the content then settles in once, as one block (opacity and a 6px rise, 280ms), the rail 60ms later. No per-section stagger and no scroll reveals: this is a tool, nobody waits for a page to perform.
- **Temperament:** genç may spring (the deck plate's leading edge, the icon hop, Niri); kurum glides on a plain ease and never hops.
- **Data draws itself:** bars fill from empty when they appear and a glint runs along the fill once; score rings and counts count up; week days pop in one after another; contour maps draw ring by ring from the summit outwards, then drift slowly.
- **Press physics:** keys sink onto their lip; pressable cards lift 2px on hover (lip grows to 5px) and sink on press.
- **Waiting on the model:** the key keeps its face and says "Niri okuyor…" while a 4px white line runs along its foot, easing to 94% over 14s; Niri's bubble says what is happening. Under reduced motion the label alone carries it.
- **Reduced motion:** every one of these is off: choreography and reveals do not hide anything, bars and contours are drawn at once.

## Elevation & Depth

Flat surfaces, physical controls. Resting cards are flat behind 2px seams. Elevation means "you can press this": a solid, unblurred lip of the element's own darker shade. Floating layers use a scrim (`ink` at 40 to 45%) or 95% ground with a light blur; only true floats (phone menu, coach card) get a blurred shadow.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Key lip** (`box-shadow: 0 3px 0 rgb(var(--key-lip))`): every key; `:active` translates 3px and the lip collapses.
- **Card lip** (`box-shadow: 0 3px 0 rgb(var(--line))`): `card-press`; same press travel.
- **Feature lip** (`box-shadow: 0 4px 0 rgb(var(--indigo-lip))`): the pressable next-step card; tap sinks it 4px.
- **Selected option** (`box-shadow: 0 4px 0 rgb(var(--indigo) / 0.5)`): a chosen `card-press` option, with indigo border and `indigo-tint` face.
- **Marker lip**: triangle markers draw their own lip, the same triangle offset 7% in `<tone>-lip` (`seam-2` when locked or waiting).
- **Segment lift** (`box-shadow: 0 2px 0 rgb(var(--line-2))`): the selected segment.
- **Field focus** (`box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgb(var(--indigo) / 0.14)`): with an indigo border.
- **Float** (`box-shadow: 0 12px 32px -12px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.25)`; coach card `0 14px 36px -14px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4)`): phone menu and Niri's coach card only.

### Named Rules
**The Lip Means Press Rule.** A lip appears only on something that responds to a press, and pressing must sink it. A static section or card never carries a lip.

## Shapes

The triangle is the system's silhouette. One path (`M50 9 91 82H9Z`, 14-unit round join) draws every marker: filled on its own lip with a white highlight stroke (done, current), `ground-3` (locked), `ground-2` with a dashed `seam-2` outline (waiting), outline (missed) or dashed (today, paused) in dense rows. Circles survive only in score rings, bars, avatars and the feedback mark.

Corners scale with the element: 8px label backings on maps, 10px small keys and segments, 12px keys and nav items, 14px fields and the segmented track, 16px inset panels and tiles, 18px cards and bubbles, 20px the indigo feature card, 24px sheets, full round for chips, pills and bars. Borders are always 2px; dashed means "not yet" (undrawn trail, today's open day, waiting marker, Beyan glyph).

## Components

### Buttons
Keys with a short, firm press.
- **Shape:** 12px (10px small).
- **Primary:** indigo face, white 16px 700 sentence-case label, 48px tall, 20px side padding, 3px `indigo-lip` lip. Small 38px / 14px, large 54px / 17px, block full width.
- **Tone keys:** orange, cyan, green, red, purple change face and lip only, and only when the action is that concept.
- **Line:** white face, 2px seam, seam lip, indigo text; hover `ground-2`. **Ink** is the same with `ink-2` text.
- **Quiet:** no face, no lip, indigo text, indigo 8% wash on hover, no travel. Utilities, close, "Geri".
- **Hover / Focus:** hover brightness 1.06; focus 3px indigo/55 outline, 2px offset. Disabled: `ground-3` face, `seam-2` lip, `ink-4` text.

### Chips and Pills
- **Chip:** white, 2px seam, full round, 13px 600 `ink-2`; filters and the goal chip.
- **Pill:** borderless tint with the tone's lip or base text, 13px 650. Level pills carry the triangle glyph: Beyan (dashed, `ground-3`/`ink-3`), Doğrulandı (outline with dot, `cyan-tint`/`cyan-lip`), Kurum onaylı (filled with white dot, `indigo-tint`/indigo).

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** 18px. **Border:** 2px `seam`. **Background:** `ground`; inset panels `ground-2` or a tone tint at 16px.
- **Shadow Strategy:** flat at rest; `card-press` carries the card lip and sinks.
- **Internal Padding:** 16 to 20px.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** `ground-2` fill, 2px seam, 14px radius, 12px 16px padding, 16px 500 text, `ink-4` placeholder, indigo caret.
- **Focus:** indigo border, `ground` fill, 4px indigo/14 ring.

### Navigation
- **Deck:** one floating object at the foot of the screen (2px seam, radius 24, 5px inset, float shadow); everything that belongs to "where am I, what is happening" lives in it, so the foot of the screen never stacks two floating bars. Phones: full width with 12px air, max 520px, 10px above the safe area. Desktop: centred, 16px above the bottom; on genç it takes the content's width (1000px) so its edges line up with the page, on kurum it hugs the tabs.
- **Tabs:** equal 92px slots on desktop, 28px two-tone icon over an 11px (12px on desktop) extrabold label; inactive `ink-3`, `ground-2` hover with the icon tilting up, the icon squeezes on press.
- **Şimdi line in the deck (genç):** beside the tabs on desktop behind a 2px vertical seam, above them on phones behind a 2px seam. On phones it tucks away (rows 1fr → 0fr, 320ms) while you read down and comes back when you scroll up. The next page's deck shows the last line before the island mounts (sessionStorage `nirengi:now`), so the line never blinks between pages.
- **Active plate:** an `indigo-tint` pill (2px inner seam, indigo at 28%) under the active tab, with a small filled indigo triangle across the seam above the tabs pointing down at it. It is placed from the server (slot index), so it is right before any script runs.
- **Tap:** genç: the plate stretches to the new tab, leading edge first on a small overshoot (280ms) and the trailing edge following 30ms later, so it moves as one body; the label turns indigo and the icon hops (squash, rise, settle). Kurum: the plate glides on a plain ease (260ms), no hop. The page changes after 320ms, once the glide is done; tab targets are prefetched. Off a tab page the plate pops in at the target instead of travelling. Reduced motion: no glide, the page changes at once.
- **Between pages:** a cross-document view transition. Top bar and deck stay still; the page leaves upward and the new one rises in.
- **Faces:** genç = Bugün, Görevler, Lig, Topluluk, Profil. kurum = Ana sayfa, İhtiyaçlar, Keşfet, Projeler, Yöntem.
- **Segmented control:** `ground-2` track, 2px seam, 4px inset; the selected segment is white, 10px, indigo text, segment lift.

### Icons
Authored two-tone SVGs on a 32px grid; each concept owns its colour. Seri is a lit survey beacon (orange triangle, gold lamp and rays; `flame-live` breathes it). XP is a faceted gold gem. Lig is a ridge in the tier colour with a summit flag. Bugün is an indigo marker over cyan ping rings. Görevler is a folded gold map with a dashed route and an indigo flag. Utility glyphs (chevrons, close, check) come from lucide at stroke 3. Status is always a drawn mark, never a Unicode glyph or emoji.

### Survey primitives (signature)
- **Contours:** faint wobbled topographic rings filling a `relative overflow-hidden` hero panel; `seam-2` at ~50% on ground, white at ~16% on indigo, a tone at ~13% on tinted heroes. Every fourth ring is heavier. They draw themselves ring by ring on arrival, then drift.
- **Tri:** the survey marker with its lip; content centred on the triangle's centroid.
- **Trail:** markers on a dashed `seam-2` line (4px, dash 2/12) that inks itself in the lead tone up to the current marker over ~0.9s. Titles sit on 8px `ground` backings; an optional caption carries status (PilotDetail uses it for each aşama's state).
- **ClimbMap ("Paftan"):** steps climb a contour map bottom-up in switchbacks; zones are dashed isolines in their tone with a "title n/m" label; the last step sits on the summit. The current point carries "Buradasın · sıradaki adım".
- **Ripple rings:** the current point pings with two staggered `ping-soft` rings in its tone (35% and 25%). This is the only "you are here" signal.
- **SurveyFlag:** indigo pole, orange cloth; drops in, settles, the cloth ripples. Planted on finished waypoints and beside Niri in celebrations.

### Screen patterns
- **Bugün:** NiriSays greeting (typing) → week card with WeekDots (seven 40px triangles: lit orange with a check, today dashed orange, past outline, future `ground-2`) → the indigo next-step card on white contours with an inner white key → "Paftan" ClimbMap in a card.
- **Görevler:** an indigo hero on contours with a Ridge and a SurveyFlag, then this week's route as waypoints: grey marker until done, lit with "Bayrağı dik" when ready, filled green with a flag once planted.
- **Lig:** the five tiers as points on one elevation profile; the climbed part fills `purple` at 14% with a purple line; standings with tier TriMarks and green/red zone dividers.
- **Assistant (both faces):** first visit Welcome (kurum 4 cards; genç 5 cards, each with Niri in a different mood: wave, point, think, cheer, happy), then once-per-page Coach spotlight tours whose Niri mood follows the step (point for "here", think for explanations, cheer for rewards), then one persistent "Niri'ye sor" key in the top bar (or the Şimdi panel's footer on genç) opening page help, "Bu sayfayı bana göster", the Sözlük and "Jüri için demo turu". Keys: `nirengi:asistan:welcome`, `nirengi:asistan:genc:welcome`, `nirengi:asistan:tour:<route>`.
- **Landing (/):** Niri narrates a short story (about 4,750px at 1920): hero (Niri climbs the trail and lands on top of each marker, positions computed in the map's own coordinates), "Ben bir nirengi noktasıyım", the XP receipt ("her XP bir iş makbuzudur"), one dense warm genç block (habit loop, live week, costume teaser, Niri's weekly note) and one calm kurum block (three steps beside the live match, three sourced numbers, no orange), closing. Bands and contour backgrounds are full-bleed; content, nav and footer share one frame (`--frame`: 1120, 1280 from 1280px, 1360 from 1600px). Every section has its own Niri placed in its layout (no sticky narrator), already wearing that section's costume (Who Zemin, receipt Tepe, genç Sırt, closing Zirve; kurum plain). Entry, once per page load when the section is 40% in view for 120ms: Niri eases from idle into `point` toward the section's focal element (receipt card, Niri's note, the live match, the doors; down on phones) while the bubble grows and types at 24ms per character (max 1.1s). No hops or spins on the landing: fast scrolling made them look silly. The genç costume chips swap the costume with a 160ms crossfade; the line swaps instantly. No third-party brand names in product copy.
- **Şimdi şeridi (genç, every page but Kanıt bağla):** the live line in the deck (see Navigation). A live Niri face blinks and hops as the bar turns through today's lines every 4.8s: the summary ("Bugün 5 ihtiyaç açık", indigo count), the closest needs (fit ring that draws itself, "Yeni" pill for needs published in the last 3 days), the next project milestone (indigo marker) and the weekly goal (beacon). Lines slide and unblur in on a spring; a thin indigo dwell line fills under them and hover/focus holds it; a sideways swipe turns it by hand. A tap morphs the line into a panel above the deck (shared layout, radius 18 → 24): Niri points down at the list and types the day's line, then project and goal tiles and every open need with ring, "Yeni" and the one skill that would raise the fit. Pull down, Esc, Kapat or the scrim fold it back. It replaces the "Niri'ye sor" key on genç pages (the panel footer carries it). Reduced motion: no turning, the summary stays.
- **Analiz (/analiz, genç):** Niri's reading from `engine/insight.ts`: weekly note (with the Monday e-mail preview), "En yakın kapın" (also on Bugün), ordered next steps, strengths, what institutions ask for. **Kurum home** opens on a calm hero band (`indigo-tint`, indigo contours at 13%, org mark, greeting, how many things wait), then "Bu hafta ihtiyaçların": four plain facts that count up, with a thin bar where a fact is a share of a whole, and the Monday summary preview; no mascot, no XP. **Keşfet** puts its title and the problem search on the same hero band.
- **Sunum (/sunum):** a projector deck inside the app; one idea per slide, Niri says one short line, the team speaks the rest. 16 slides for jury and investors: problem (sourced), why now, the difference, the loop, both faces, trust, live demo, who first, competition by category (never brand names), how it lives (every option tagged Hipotez, "Bugün gelirimiz yok"), where we are today (working vs not yet), pilot metrics (targets, empty values), roadmap, the ask, team. Every number comes from `docs/PAZAR-ANALIZI.md` with its source on the slide or from the engine. On a slide change the bubble stays, flexes for 200ms and types the new line at once while Niri does a ~0.45s squash and half-turn; the slide's mood is on from the first frame (no generic talking face in between) and stage Niri ignores hover/tap reactions (full spin only for the closing Zirve); costumes climb to Zirve at the close. N opens the synced presenter window (`/sunum?notlar`, notes in `sunum/notes.ts`, also `docs/SUNUM-NOTLARI.md`).

### Feedback, celebration and sheets
- **`feedback({tone, title, text?, xp?, streak?, action?})`:** a compact floating toast (2px seam, radius 18, soft float shadow, no lip), bottom-centre, above the dock. A 52px mini Niri reacts (good happy, good with xp/streak cheer, bad sad with a small shake, info talk); the tone is a drawn triangle mark next to the title, never a coloured slab. `xp` adds a counting gold gem chip, `streak` a beacon chip. A thin tone line shrinks over 4.2s (5.6s with chips), pauses on hover/focus; X or swipe down dismisses; at most two stack. Marked `.feedback-dock` while visible so floating keys lift by its real height.
- **`celebrate({title, sub?, xp?, streak?, cta?, href?})`:** full screen on 95% ground; four rounded-triangle rings spread once behind Niri (cheer, 150px), 32 triangle confetti in palette tones, a SurveyFlag drops in, a 30 to 36px title, optional XP (gold, gem) and Seri (orange, beacon) tiles, one large primary key ("Devam et"). Kurum omits `xp` and `streak`.
- **Sheet / Why:** "Neden?" is a sentence-case indigo 13px trigger; the sheet is a bottom sheet (24px top corners, max 85dvh) on phones and a 512px centred panel from sm.
- **EmptyState:** a card with Niri (think, 96px), an 18px title and the next step as an action.

### Niri
The triangle surveyor, pure SVG. Moods: idle, happy, cheer, think, wave, sad, point, talk, sleep. NiriSays sets Niri beside an 18px-radius, 2px-seam bubble with a rotated-square tail; on every new message Niri hops and the bubble grows from its tail; with `typing` the text types in (max 600ms) while Niri talks. Niri reacts to `feedback()`: good = happy plus a hop, bad = sad, info = looks up. Pupils follow the cursor on fine pointers. Under reduced motion every mood shows its finished static pose, and rings, flag and dust stop. On the genç side Niri wears the league tier's costume (`gear`: Zemin ribbon, Tepe field cap, Sırt bandana and map roll, Doruk helmet with lamp and ranging pole, Zirve goggles and summit flag); kurum screens never show gear, and Niri never sits on candidate scores, reasons or the ledger. `NiriTwirl` wraps a Niri so a change of mood, line or costume is a crouch, hop and Y-axis spin with the swap edge-on (reduced motion: crossfade). `lively` (genç greeting, league header, notebook only) adds the idle pool: glance, weight shift, stretch, foot tap, fiddling with the costume, an occasional spin, slow blinks; taps combo hop → happy hop → spin, five fast taps make it dizzy. `cueAct="spin"` plays the spin on demand. **Saha defteri** (Niri's field notebook, `genc/SahaDefteri.tsx`, rules in `genc/defter.ts`): nine numbered pages, five league costumes plus four tools earned from real events (No. 06 büyüteç: first Doğrulandı work; 07 onay mührü: first Kurum onaylı milestone; 08 seri feneri: 4-week streak; 09 pusula: a helpful community answer). Locked pages are silhouettes with "???" and the unlock hint; "Giy" / "Eline ver" sets what Niri wears on genç screens (`useWorn`). Opened by the `nirengi:defter` event, `#defter`, the Bugün greeting Niri, GencRail, the league page and "Niri'ye sor"; never rendered on kurum.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** give every key and pressable card its 3px same-hue lip and make `:active` sink 3px onto it.
- **Do** draw progress, markers and "you are here" with the triangle, the dashed trail and ripple rings.
- **Do** put Contours behind hero panels only (the next-step card, page heroes), never behind body text.
- **Do** write every label in sentence case and address the reader as "sen".
- **Do** answer every action with `feedback()` and milestones with `celebrate()`.
- **Do** put explanations, formulas and thresholds behind "Neden?" in a Sheet.
- **Do** read every number from the engine (`src/lib/engine/progress.ts`) and explain it on /yontem.
- **Do** label fictional demo data where it appears (13px bold `ink-3`).
- **Do** keep the kurum face on the same grammar with Niri as assistant and no XP, league or streak.
- **Do** keep reduced motion working: CSS animation zeroed, `MotionGlobalConfig.skipAnimations`, no confetti or rings, count-ups jump, Niri static.

### Don't:
- **Don't** use more than one Niri on a screen.
- **Don't** use orange on any kurum screen.
- **Don't** set `orange`, `gold` or their lips as text on a light ground, or use `ink-4` for readable text.
- **Don't** put a lip on a static section or card.
- **Don't** use blurred shadows on resting surfaces or 1px hairlines.
- **Don't** use a Unicode glyph or emoji as an icon or status mark.
- **Don't** show S1 / S2 / S3 outside /yontem.

### Do not regress (round 1 patterns that are gone):
- **Don't** bring back the circle lesson path; steps are triangle markers on a trail or the climb map.
- **Don't** bring back the full-width bottom answer bar; acknowledgements are the floating toast.
- **Don't** use a reward chest; quests are waypoints you plant a flag on.
- **Don't** set uppercase keys, nav or labels.
- **Don't** pin a lesson footer (X plus a fixed Devam bar) on flows; the key sits in flow.
- **Don't** put a counter strip (league, streak, XP) in the phone header; it carries the wordmark only.
- **Don't** use pin bubbles or bobbing callouts over the current step; it gets ripple rings and a plain caption below.
- **Don't** use flame, chest or lightning imagery; Seri is a beacon, XP is a gem.
